## Introduction

Access to timely and accurate medical advice is a challenge, especially in remote areas. The Medicine Recommendation System addresses this by utilizing machine learning algorithms to predict diseases based on user-input symptoms and providing corresponding treatment recommendations. This approach aims to bridge the healthcare accessibility gap by offering quick, reliable, and cost-effective health recommendations. 

## Features

- **Symptom-Based Disease Prediction**: Input your symptoms to receive a predicted diagnosis.
- **Personalized Treatment Recommendations**: Obtain tailored advice on medications, diets, and workout routines.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easily navigate and input information through an intuitive design.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Receive instant predictions and recommendations.
- **Comprehensive Health Guidance**: Beyond medications, get advice on diet and exercise for holistic health management.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for model development.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive computing environment.
- **Flask**: Web framework for deploying the application.
